# Detection Visualizer üé®üñåÔ∏è

Over engineered, satisfying and easy to use package to visualize object detection
datasets and predictions.

## Dependencies
The goal is to keep this package as independent and simple as possible. There is only two dependencies:
* [NumPy](https://pypi.org/project/numpy/)
* [OpenCV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)

## How to use?

So you have an image and a bunch of annotations for that image. Each annotaion could be
eather `BoundingBox` or `Mask`.

Note that you can mix multiple types of annotations together for an image. you pass your
image as numpy ndarray and a list of these annotations to an instance of the
`Visualizer` class and thats it! The `Visualizer` instance will return result image as
numpy ndarray.

*Warning: There is a chane that original image be mutated in the visualizer so if thats
important to you make a copy of it before passing it to the visualizer.*

## TODO:
* Add a proper documentation.
